Developed an interactive image matching game using ReactJS, where users match a displayed image with a correct thumbnail from a list.

Implemented game logic with state management, including timer countdown, score tracking, and randomized image selection.

Integrated reusable components like Navbar, TabItem, GameItem, and ScoreCard to create a modular and maintainable codebase.

Used setInterval for timer functionality and handled game-over scenarios on mismatch or timeout.

Applied conditional rendering to dynamically update UI based on game state.
